# Welcome  


I'm Zorah. This is my little corner of the internet - I hope you enjoy your visit :3

Currently, I'm invested in the world of [[Web Development]]. Coming from a decade in Telecommunications and [[IT]]. I often joke that my career progression is like climbing up the OSI model. Since I started from running Ethernet & Fiber, installing all kinds of network devices, to supporting server/network infrastructure and end-users as a technician in the [MSP](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-managed-service-provider/) industry. I'm also interested in [[Entreprenuership]] and using that as a vehicle to become a more practical and effective developer. 

Now I'm building my own software after years of installing or troubleshooting them for others. This is not a blog, but a digital garden that's just getting started after learning about this concept from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) several years ago. Excited to build and share my experiences in public with anyone who's interested.
