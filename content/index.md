# Welcome

Hey there, I'm Zorah! Welcome to my cozy corner of the internet â€“ excited to have you here! :3

I'm currently knee-deep in the world of [[Web Development]], and it's been quite a journey. A decade in Telecommunications and [[IT]], I like to joke that my career path is like climbing up the OSI model. I began by running Ethernet & Fiber, installing all sorts of network devices, and eventually found myself supporting server/network infrastructure and end-users as a techie in the MSP industry.

But guess what? I've got my eyes on more than just tech. [[Entrepreneurship]] is my other passion, and I'm using it as a vehicle to become a more hands-on and effective developer. Now, after spending years installing and troubleshooting software for others, I'm on a new adventure â€“ building it myself and participating in open source.

This isn't your typical blog; think of it as a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) that's just starting to bloom. I stumbled upon this concept a few years back from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/), and I'm stoked to cultivate and share my experiences in public. Whether you're a fellow developer, tech enthusiast, or just curious about the journey â€“ stick around, and let's explore this together! ðŸŒ±
