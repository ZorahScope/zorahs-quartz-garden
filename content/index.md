# Welcome

Hello there, I'm Zorah! Welcome to my corner of the internet â€“ glad to have you here! :3

This is not a blog, this is my Digital Garden ðŸŒ±. Here you'll find plots dedicated to several of my interests such as [[Web Development]], [[IT |IT ( Linux Sysadmin / Networking )]], and [[Entrepreneurship]]. 

I stumbled upon this concept after hearing Maggie Appleton speak about it in a podcast several years ago. The idea appealed to me much more than what the _blog_ has become nowadays. It seemed like a more sustainable way to both consistently write online and learn in public without the pressure of perfectionism. While also facilitating growth, exploration, and joy from sharing with others. 

A definition of what a digital garden is from [Maggie Appleton - A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):

> [!quote]
> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

Please see the [**not-legally-binding Terms of Service**](https://github.com/swyxio/digital-garden-tos) I subscribe too as a digital gardener. Some of the systems needed to adhere to such terms are still in-progress while I figure out what my style of digital gardening will look like starting out, such as [epistemic disclosure](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing) . So more to come :)
