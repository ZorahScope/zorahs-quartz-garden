# About me

Hello there :) , My name is Zorah. A aspiring web developer coming from a decade of combined experience in Telecommunications and currently IT. 

I often joke that my career progression is like climbing the OSI model. Since I started from the bottom layer running Ethernet cabling or fiber optics and installing various equipment such as firewalls/routers, switches, workstations, POS systems, cameras, A\V and iOT devices.

From there I eventually found myself supporting server and network infrastructure along with the end-users who depend on them as a support technician in the MSP industry. Now I’m on a new adventure – building my own software and participating in the world of open source.

When I'm not hacking on something, I'm spending time with my partner and/or enjoying the various pleasures in life. Such as video games ( Switch & PS5), Anime, and all kinds of comics ( Webtoons, Manga, Manwha, Manhua, etc.) . I like to make vegan food and make artisan bread from scratch when I have the time for it.
